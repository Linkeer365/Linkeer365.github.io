# Aiming

In response to this discussion, our group established a game model to explain the four possible equilibrium situations stated in the problem.

# Analysis Procedures

## Assumptions

First we give the following model assumptions:
1. There are only two populations in the society, infected and uninfected. The behavior of one population is exactly the same. For example, all the infected person wears a mask or not. There is no situation where some infected people wear masks while the other part of the population don’t.
2. Masks can 100% isolate people from the virus; however, if neither party(infected and uninfected) wears a mask, the uninfected person must be infected, but the risk of infection will not change with the changing number of infected persons.
3. The government will punish the infected people who do not wear masks, but the fines will not change with the changing number of infected people; the unit price of the masks also remains unchanged;

Before explaining the model, we want to clearly explain and define the parameters used in our model.

## Parameters Mapping

| Parameter | Explanation |
| :--- | :--- |
| N | Number of infected people |
| M | Number of uninfected people |
| P | Unit price of the masks |	
| F | Money fines for each infected person without a mask |
| C | Medical fees for one infected person |	
> All parameters we use are in absolute

## Diagrams

So here we randomly draw an infected person and an uninfected person from the population, and the choice of these two will represent their group selection.

## Case-by-case Analysis

1. When both parties wear masks, both parties only need to pay for the masks, i.e. (-P, -P)
2. When the infected person wears a mask and the uninfected person does not, the infected person bears the cost of the mask and the uninfected person has no loss, i.e. (-P, 0)
3. When the infected person does not wear a mask and the uninfected person wears, the infected will bear the government's fine, and the uninfected bears the cost of the mask, i.e. (-F, -P)
4. When neither party wears a mask, the infected person bears the government's fine, and the uninfected person bears the risk of being infected, i.e. (-F, -C)

## Mathemetics Domain Model 

These four blocks correspond to the situations in the question. The social losses of the four blocks are:

<details><summary>Y-Y Case</summary> 

N * (-P) + M * (-P) = - (N + M) * P   —— (c)
</details>

<details><summary>Y-N Case</summary>

N * (-P) + M * 0 = - N * P   —— (a)</details>

<details><summary>N-Y Case</summary> 

 N * (-F) +  M * (-P)   —— (b) </details>

<details><summary>N-N Case</summary> 

N * (-F) + M * (-C) = - N * F + (- M * C)   —— (d)</details>


# Final Conclusions

<details><summary>For question (a) </summary>

if the price of mask P is far less than the government fine F and infection risk C, i.e. P < N/ (N - M) * F and P < F + (M/N) * C, then the strategy a: Only infected people choose to wear masks is the best strategy.

</details>
<details><summary>For question (b) </summary>

if the government fine is really small and the mask price P far less than the infection risk C, at the same time N > M, then the strategy: Only infected people choose to wear masks is the best.

</details>
<details><summary>For question (c) </summary>

we cannot figure out the feasible solution using this model, but through our analysis, we find a situation that when 1. Masks can prevent the spread of the virus effectively. 2. The virus is highly pathogenic. Uninfected people do not want to get infected. Infected people will get heavier illness if they not wearing masks and having touch with other infected people without masks. then the strategy: Everybody wears a mask is the best.

</details><details><summary>For question (d) </summary>

when N > M, the infection risk C and government fine F far less than the mask price P, i.e. F < (N * P – M * C)/N and C < (N/M) * (P – F), then the strategy: Nobody wears a mask is the best.
